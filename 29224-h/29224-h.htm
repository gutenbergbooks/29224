<h3>(1728-1814)</h3>


<p>Most of the literature&mdash;orations as well as broadsides&mdash;created
in America under the heat of the Revolution, was of a strictly
satirical character. Most of the Revolutionary ballads sung at
the time were bitter with hatred against the Loyalist. When
the conflict actually was in progress, the theatres that regaled
the Colonists were closed, and an order from the Continental
Congress declared that theatre-going was an amusement from
which all patriotic people should abstain. These orders or
resolutions were dated October 12, 1778, and October 16. (Seilhamer,
ii, 51.) The playhouses were no sooner closed, however&mdash;much
to the regret of Washington&mdash;than their doors were
thrown wide open by the British troops stationed in Boston,
New York, and Philadelphia. A complete history of the American
stage has to deal with Howe's players, Clinton's players,
and Burgoyne's players.</p>

<p>Of all these Red-Coat Thespians, two demand our attention&mdash;one,
Major Andr&eacute;, a gay, talented actor; the other, General Burgoyne,
whose pride was as much concerned with playwriting as
with generalship. The latter dipped his pen in the satirical inkpot,
and wrote a farce, "The Blockade of Boston." It was
this play that drew forth from a woman, an American playwright,
the retort stinging. This lady was Mrs. Mercy Warren<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
who, although distinguished for being a sister of James Otis,
and the wife of General James Warren, was in her own name
a most important and distinct literary figure during the
Revolution.</p>

<p>So few women appear in the early history of American Drama
that it is well here to mention Mrs. Charlotte Ramsay Lennox
(1720-1804) and Mrs. Susanna Rowson (1762-1824). The former
has the reputation of being the first woman, born in America,
to have written a play, "The Sister" (1769). The author
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>moved to London when she was fifteen, and there it was her
piece was produced, with an epilogue by Oliver Goldsmith. She
is referred to in Boswell's Life of Johnson.</p>

<p>Of Susanna Rowson, whose Memoir has been issued by Rev.
Elias Nason, we know that, as a singer and actress, she created
sufficient reputation in London to attract the attention of Wignell,
the comedian. (Clapp. Boston Stage. 1853, p. 41.)</p>

<p>With her husband, she came to this country in 1793, and,
apart from her professional duties on the stage, wrote a farce,
"Volunteers" (1795), dealing with the Whiskey Insurrection in
Pennsylvania, "The Female Patriot" (1794), "Slaves in Algiers;
or, A Struggle for Freedom" (1794), and "Americans in England"
(1796). All of these were produced. Her literary attainments
were wide, her most popular novel being "Charlotte
Temple, a Tale of Truth" (1790). She likewise compiled many
educational works. (See Wegelin.)</p>

<p>The picture conjured up in our mind of Mrs. Warren is
farthest away from satire. To judge by the costume she wore
when she sat to Copley for her portrait, she must have been
graced with all the feminine wiles of the period. Behold Mrs.
Mercy Warren, satirist, as the records describe her:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Her head-dress is of white lace, trimmed with white satin ribbons.
Her robe is of dark-green satin, with a pompadour waist, trimmed
with point lace. There is a full plait at the back, hanging from the
shoulders, and her sleeves are also of point lace. White illusion,
trimmed with point lace, and fastened with a white satin bow, covers
her neck. The front of the skirt and of the sleeves are elaborately
trimmed with puffings of satin.</p></div>

<p>But however agreeable this picture may be, Mrs. Warren, on
reading Burgoyne's farce, immediately sharpened her pen, and
replied by writing a counter-farce, which she called "The Blockheads;
or, the Affrighted Officers."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It was in the prologue to
this play that the poet-dramatist wrote:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Your pardon first I crave for this intrusion.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The topic's such it looks like a delusion;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And next your candour, for I swear and vow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such an attempt I never made till now.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But constant laughing at the Desp'rate fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bastard sons of Mars endur'd of late,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Induc'd me thus to minute down the notion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which put my risibles in such commotion.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By yankees frighted too! oh, dire to say!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why yankees sure at red-coats faint away!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, yes&mdash;They thought so too&mdash;for lack-a-day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their gen'ral turned the <i>blockade</i> to a play:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor vain poltroons&mdash;with justice we'll retort,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And call them <i>blockheads</i> for their idle sport.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Unfortunately, we cannot test the comparative value of satire
as used by Burgoyne and Mrs. Warren, because the Burgoyne
play is not in existence. But, undoubtedly, our Revolutionary
enthusiast knew how to wield her pen in anger, and she reflects
all of the bitter spirit of the time. Not only is this apparent in
"The Blockheads," but likewise in "The Group," a piece which
holds up to ridicule a number of people well known to the Boston
of that day.</p>

<p>Mrs. Warren was the writer of many plays, as well as being
noted for her "History of the American Revolution" (1805),
and for her slim volume of poems (1790), which follow the conventional
sentiments of the conventionally sentimental English
poetry of that time.</p>

<p>In "The Group" we obtain her interesting impressions, in
dramatic form, of North and Gage and, from the standpoint of
the library, we regard with reverence the little copy of the play
printed on the day before the battle of Lexington&mdash;a slim brochure,
aimed effectively at Tory politicians.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>In fact, mention the name Tory to Mrs. Warren, and her wit
was ever ready to sharpen its shafts against British life in
America. That is probably why so many believe she wrote
"The Motley Assembly," a farce, though some there be who
claim that its authorship belongs to J. M. Sewall. Dr. F. W.
Atkinson asserts that this was the first American play to have
in it only American characters.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The satirical farce was a popular dramatic form of the time.
Mrs. Warren was particularly effective in wielding such a
polemic note, for instance, when she deals with the Boston
Massacre in her Tragedy, "The Adulateur" (Boston: Printed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
and sold at the New Printing-Office, /Near Concert-Hall./
M,DCC,LXXIII./). On the King's side, however, the writers
were just as effective. Such an example is seen in "The Battle
of Brooklyn, A farce of Two Acts: as it was performed at
Long-Island, on Tuesday, the 27th of August, 1776, By the
Representatives of the Tyrants of America, Assembled at
Philadelphia" (Edinburgh: Printed in the Year M.DCC.
LXXVII.), in which the British ridicule all that is Continental,
even Washington. This farce was reprinted in Brooklyn, 1873.</p>

<p>Jonathan Mitchell Sewall's (1748-1808) "A Cure for the
Spleen; or, Amusement for a Winter's Evening" (1775) was
another Tory protest, which carried the following pretentious
subtitle: "Being the substance of a conversation on the Times,
over a friendly tankard and pipe, between Sharp, a country
Parson; Bumper, a country Justice; Fillpot, an inn-keeper;
Graveairs, a Deacon; Trim, a Barber; Brim, a Quaker; Puff,
a late Representative. Taken in short-hand by Roger de
Coverly."</p>

<p>Mrs. Warren was the intimate friend of many interesting
people. It concerns us, however, that her most significant correspondence
of a literary nature was carried on with John Adams,
afterwards President of the United States. This friendship
remained unbroken until such time as Mrs. Warren found it
necessary to picture Adams in her History of the Revolution;
when he objected to the portraiture.</p>

<p>The student of history is beholden to Mr. Adams for many
of those intimate little sketches of Revolutionary and early
national life in America, without which our impressions would
be much the poorer. His admiration for Mrs. Warren was great,
and even in his correspondence with her husband, James Warren,
he never allowed an opportunity to slip for alluding to her work
as a literary force in the life of the time. I note, for example, a
letter he wrote on December 22, 1773, suggesting a theme which
would "become" Mrs. Warren's pen, "which has no equal that
I know of in this country."</p>

<p>In 1775, after "The Group" was written, and, according to
custom, submitted by Warren to John Adams for criticism and
approval, we find him praising Mrs. Warren, and quoting from
her play. So poignantly incisive was Mrs. Warren's satire that
many people would not credit her with the pieces she actually
wrote, and there were those who thought it incredible that a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
woman should use satire so openly and so flagrantly as she.
The consequence is, many of her contemporaries attributed the
writing of "The Group" to masculine hands, and this attitude
drew from Mrs. Warren the following letter written to Mr.
Adams:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>My next question, sir, you may deem impertinent. Do you remember
who was the author of a little pamphlet entitled, <i>The Group?</i>
To your hand it was committed by the writer. You brought it forward
to the public eye. I will therefore give you my reason for
naming it now. A friend of mine, who lately visited the Athen&aelig;um
[a Boston Library], saw it among a bundle of pamphlets, with a
high encomium of the author, who, he asserted, was Mr. Samuel
Barrett. You can, if you please, give a written testimony contradictory
of the false assertion.</p></div>

<p>This letter was written long after the Revolution, when she
was not loath to let it be known that she was the creator of this
little play, and is clearly indicative of the general attitude the
public had toward Mrs. Warren as an author. Her appeal instantly
called forth a courteous rejoinder from Mr. Adams,
who wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What brain could ever have conceived or suspected Samuel Barrett,
Esquire, to have been the author of "The Group"? The bishop
has neither the natural genius nor the acquired talents, the knowledge
of characters, nor the political principles, sentiments, or feelings, that
could have dictated that pungent drama. His worthy brother, the
Major, might have been as rationally suspected.</p>

<p>I could take my Bible oath to two propositions, 1st. That Bishop
Barrett, in my opinion, was one of the last literary characters in the
world who ought to have been suspected to have written "The
Group." 2d. That there was but one person in the world, male or
female, who could at that time, in my opinion, have written it;
and that person was Madam Mercy Warren, the historical, philosophical,
poetical, and satirical consort of the then Colonel, since
General, James Warren of Plymouth, sister of the great, but forgotten,
James Otis.</p></div>

<p>According to Adams, he immediately went to the Boston
Athen&aelig;um, where his nephew, W. S. Shaw, was Librarian. He
drew from the shelves a copy of "The Group", which had been
bought from the collection of Governor Adams of Massachusetts,
and forthwith, on looking it over, wrote down the original<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
names of the people satirized therein.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> This copy is still a valuable
possession of the library.</p>

<p>While Mrs. Warren was writing "The Group," she sent it
piecemeal to her husband, who was on the field of battle. He,
being proud of the literary attainments of his wife, sent it
around to his friends, under seal of secrecy. And his appeal to
these friends was very significant of the pride he felt in the manuscript.
Here is what he wrote to Adams, on January 15, 1775:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Inclosed are for your amusement two Acts of a dramatic performance
composed at my particular desire. They go to you as they
came out of the hand of the Copier, without pointing or marking.
If you think it worth while to make any other use of them than a
reading, you will prepare them in that way &amp; give them such
other Corrections &amp; Amendments as your good Judgment shall
suggest.</p></div>

<p>It gradually became known among Warren's friends who the
real writer of the satire was, much to the consternation of Mrs.
Mercy Warren. She was modest to the extreme, usually being
thrust into writing on particular subjects by the enthusiasm of
her friends. For example, she wrote a poem on the Boston
Tea Party, and, in sending it to her husband, she confessed that
it was a task</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>done in consequence of the request of a much respected friend. It
was wrote off with little attention.... I do not think it has sufficient
merit for the public eye.</p></div>

<p>By the same post, she sent him another scene from "The
Group."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Whatever you do with either of them [meaning the manuscripts],
you will doubtless be careful that the author is not exposed, and hope
your particular friends will be convinced of the propriety of not
naming her at present.</p></div>

<p>Mrs. Warren was the author of several other plays, among
them "The Adulateur" and "The Retreat," which preceded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
"The Group" in date of composition, and "The Sack of Rome."
The latter was contained in a volume of poems issued in 1790,
in which "The Ladies of Castile" was dedicated to President
Washington, who wrote the author a courteous note in acknowledgment.</p>

<p>In the preface to this volume, Mrs. Warren gives her impressions
of the stage, which are excellent measure of the regard
Americans of this period had for the moral influence of the playhouse.
Thus, she writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Theatrical amusements may, sometimes, have been prostituted
to the purposes of vice; yet, in an age of taste and refinement, lessons
of morality, and the consequences of deviation, may, perhaps,
be as successfully enforced from the stage, as by modes of instruction,
less censured by the severe; while, at the same time, the exhibition
of great historical events, opens a field of contemplation to the
reflecting and philosophic mind.</p></div>

<p>But Mrs. Warren was not entirely given over to the serious
occupations of literary work. We find her on intimate terms
with Mrs. Adams, the two of them in their daily association
calling each other <i>Portia</i> and <i>Marcia</i>.</p>

<p>Who actually played in "The Group" when it was given a
performance is not recorded. We know, however, from records,
that it was given for the delectation of the audiences assembled
"nigh head quarters, at Amboyne." This evidence is on the
strength of Mrs. Warren's own statement. Sanction for the
statement appears on the title-pages of the New York, John
Anderson, issue of 1775,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and the Jamaica-Philadelphia, James
Humphreys, Jr., edition of the same year.</p>

<p>I have selected this play, "The Group," as being an excellent
example of the partisan writing done at the time of our American
Revolution, and no one can afford to overlook it, although
its actable qualities, according to our present-day judgment,
are doubtful.</p>

<span class="i0">And with a phiz of Crocodilian stamp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can weep, and wreathe, still hoping to deceive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He cries the gath'ring clouds hang thick about her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But laughs within&mdash;&mdash;then sobs&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">&mdash;&mdash;Alas! my country?<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p class="center gap2"><span class="smcap">Hum Humbug.</span></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Why so severe, or why exclaim at all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the man who made thee what thou art?<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p class="center gap2"><span class="smcap">Beau Trumps.</span></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">I know his guilt,&mdash;I ever knew the man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy father knew him e'er we trod the stage;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I only speak to such as know him well;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Abroad I tell the world he is a saint,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as for int'rest I betray'd my own<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the same views, I rank'd among his friends:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But my ambition sighs for something more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What merits has Sir Sparrow of his own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet a feather graces the fool's cap:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which did he wear for what himself achiev'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twould stamp some honour on his latest heir&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I'll suspend my murm'ring care awhile;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, t' other glass&mdash;&mdash;and try our luck at Loo,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if before the dawn your gold I win,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or e'er bright Ph&oelig;bus does his course begin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The eastern breeze from Britain's hostile shore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should waft her lofty floating towers o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose waving pendants sweep the wat'ry main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dip their proud beaks and dance towards the plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The destin'd plains of slaughter and distress,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laden with troops from Hanover and Hess,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It would invigorate my sinking soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For then the continent we might control;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not all the millions that she vainly boasts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can cope with Veteran Barbarian hosts;&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the brave sons of Albion's warlike race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their arms, and honours, never can disgrace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or draw their swords in such a hated cause,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In blood to seal a N&mdash;&mdash;'s oppressive laws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They'll spurn the service;&mdash;&mdash;Britons must recoil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shew themselves the natives of an isle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who sought for freedom, in the worst of times<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Produc'd her Hampdens, Fairfaxes, and Pyms.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But if by carnage we should win the game,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps by my abilities and fame:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I might attain a splendid glitt'ring car,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mount aloft, and sail in liquid air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like Pha&euml;ton, I'd then out-strip the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leave my low competitors behind.<br /></span>
